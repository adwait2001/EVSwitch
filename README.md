# EV & Go

EV & Go is a web application that surveys users on their existing car needs and presents them with EV (electric vehicle) alternative to help accelerate and ease the transition to electrical vehicles.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this application was to create a way to present the research on electric cars that I had accumulated over the past year. It provides a way for me to make targeted recommendations to those looking to purchase an EV. It also provided me a way to test out 3D animation and 3D modelling via three.js.
